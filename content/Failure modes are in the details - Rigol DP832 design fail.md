It's pretty crazy that a 5V linear regulator, _powering the display circuitry_, being improperly heat-sinked causes the whole $400 precision power supply to reset. Apparently this is for pre-2013 Rigol DP832s/DP832As (see also [Linear Regulators Are (not) That Hot](Linear%20Regulators%20Are%20(not)%20That%20Hot.md)).

"5W, it's bloody ridiculous, did no one even stick their finger on this or think about it?"
