biquinary
**:** of, based on, being, or relating to a mixed-base system of numbers in which each decimal digit _n_ is represented as a pair of digits _xy_ where _n_ = 5 _x_ + _y_ and _x_ is written in base 2 (binary) as 0 or 1 and _y_ is written in base 5 (quinary) as 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. 

Biquinary counting is another way to represent decimal (base-10) digits using a pair of binary (base-2) and quinary (base-5) sections. The first section represents the switch between 0-4 and 5-9 and the section represents 0-4. 

This was used in relay-based computers to make error checking easier for the encoded decimal value - as seen below there must always be a single active digit in both the upper and lower sections.

Moving to digital electronics, we can use just 4 bits, with the top bit being the 0-4/5-9 switch and the bottom three bits representing 0-4 (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101).

BCD counters like the 74LS90 separate out the mod-2 and mod-5 counters to allow the user to wire the counter in output modes of binary-coded-decimal counter (typical) or biquinary-coded-decimal (amongst others).

## Standard Decade Counter with a 74LS90

When using the 74LS90 BCD decade counter for the first time I was wondering why they had two separate counters in side, a mod-2 counter and a mod-5 counter.

The common way to configure the 74LS90 as a BCD 4-bit decade counter is as follows ([source](https://www.uobabylon.edu.iq/eprints/publication_12_16297_163.pdf))- `CLK A` is the mod-2 counter input and `CLK B` is the mod-5 counter input:

_By connecting, `Q_A`, the output of the mod-2 counter (1-bit output that toggles every two cycles) to, `CLK_B`, the input of the mod-5 counter (3 bit output that counts up to 5), we create a mod-10 (decade) counter._

## Biquinary Counter

But we can also create a _biquinary_ counter, where for the 4 bit output the bottom 3 bits have two cycles of incrementing from `000...100`, and the MSB is `0` for the first 5 sub-cycles, and `1` for the last 5. A timing and state diagram explains it better:

_Note clocks are falling edge triggered. The way to setup the biquinary counter is to have the main clock input into `CLK B` (the mod-5 counter) and have the `Q_D` output (MSB of the mod-5 counter) as the input to `CLK A`. This means when the mod-5 MSB goes from `1`â†’`0` (on the 5th count) the mod-2 counter will toggle. Note that the biquinary outputs must be taken as shown, with `Q_A` as the MSB and `Q_B` as the LSB._

**Usefulness**

The top bit can be thought of as a checksum .This way of counting is actually used in the Japanese abacus counting system. It seems it is also used in one of the worlds oldest existing working computers [[hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2019/08/03/maybe-the-oldest-computer-probably-the-oddest/)], but there it is implemented with 7 relays for 7 digits, instead of the 4 bits above.
